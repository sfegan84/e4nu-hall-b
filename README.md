# e4nu-hall-b
e4nu code for JLab hall B analysis, derived from https://github.com/adishka/e4nu

New repository for significant structural changes to code base, with an eye on moving from run group and channel specific analysis (e2a, zero pion, one pion) to wider JLab analysis, including data mining

Work in progress, this file will be updated with more information in due course
Status as of March 2021: direct analysis of input root trees rewritten to better separate JLab run-specific elements of event selection from neutrino analysis. Next major update will apply these updates to data filtering into a GENIE tree format
