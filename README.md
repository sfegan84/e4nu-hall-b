# e4nu-hall-b
e4nu code for JLab hall B analysis, derived from https://github.com/adishka/e4nu

New repository for significant structural changes to code base, with an eye on moving from run group and channel specific analysis (e2a, zero pion, one pion) to wider JLab analysis, including data mining

Work in progress, this file will be updated with more information in due course
