* Version of the e2a/e4nu (electrons for neutrinos) analysis code
* for the one proton, one pion channel. Derives from the e4nu analysis
* code already built by the group, however, significant divergence
* necessary in order to improve readability/debugging
*
* v0.1  March  3rd, 2020 - implementing previous tweaks and changes tested
*                          elsewhere, including ROOT v6 compatible vertex
*                          correction functions.  Attempting to make efforts
*                          to refactor code and untangle some of the logical
*                          knots
* v0.2  March  9th, 2020 - Moving beam-energy specific variable declarations 
*                          of e2a_ep...::loop() to separate header files in a 
*                          "myHeaders" folder (also added to Makefile)
* v0.21 March 10th, 2020 - two proton particle kinematics now in a loop, in
*                          preparation for a generic function for multi-
*                          proton (>2) events
* v0.22 March 13th, 2020 - Dealing with the many compiler warnings in e2a_ep...
*                          mostly potentially unitialised variables in if
*                          statememnts, resolved by initialising at declaration
*                          to nonsense values (e.g. -999)
* v0.23 March 16th, 2020 - Applying corrections to resolve e2a_ep... compiler
*                          warnings from unused variables. Tidying up z-vertex
*                          correction file loading
* v0.3  April  1st, 2020 - Propagating some e2a_ep improvements to FilterData
*                          Fundamental restructuring of e2a_ep... loop, post
*                          event selection histogram processing doesn't need to
*                          be there
* v0.31 April  9th, 2020 - Streamlining of creation and momentum correction of
*                          proton 4-vectors in the 2-proton case. Checking harmonisation
*                          of variable names with higher proton multiplicities
* v0.32 April 17th, 2020 - Moving some proton corrections for multi-proton events to a function
*
* v1.0    May  6th, 2020 - Changing filenames and preparing for proper plot production of 1p1pi case
*

* Ideas for future versions - Subdirectories for histograms
*                           - Better coding practices
*                           - Individual functions for the subtractions 
*                             for the various proton and pion cases
*                           - More generic delcaration of particle
*                             kinematics after particle ID
*                           - Electron and hadron selections in bespoke functions
*                           - Remove unused variables
*                           - Remove shadowed declarations of local variables
*                           - z-vertex correction parameters in a C++ data structure,
*                             rather than loading a gazillion root files
*                           - ensure anything generic or outsourced to functions
*                             from e2a_ep... also applies to FilterData
*			    - Output file paths set from a command line argument
